        <li><b>Rice (Oryza sativa)</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Water Requirements: Rice is a water-intensive crop and requires standing water for a significant portion of its growth cycle. It is often cultivated in flooded paddies, making water management crucial.</li>
                <li>Temperature Range: Rice is typically grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It requires warm temperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C (68°F to 95°F) during its growth period.</li>
                <li>Soil Type: Rice grows well in clayey soils that can retain water. Well-drained soils are not suitable for rice cultivation due to its water requirements.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Wheat (Triticum spp.)</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Water Requirements: Wheat requires moderate water levels. It's important to provide adequate irrigation during critical growth stages like germination, tillering, and grain filling.</li>
                <li>Temperature Range: Wheat is a cool-season crop. It grows best in temperatures between 15°C and 20°C (59°F to 68°F) during the growing season.</li>
                <li>Soil Type: Well-drained loamy soils are ideal for wheat cultivation. Soil with good moisture retention capacity supports healthy growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Maize (Zea mays):</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Water Requirements: Maize requires consistent moisture, especially during its flowering and grain-filling stages. Adequate irrigation is essential for optimal yield.</li>
                <li>Temperature Range: Maize is a warm-season crop and thrives in temperatures between 20°C and 30°C (68°F to 86°F).</li>
                <li>Soil Type: Maize grows well in a variety of soil types, but well-drained loamy soils with good fertility are preferred.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Cotton (Gossypium spp.):</b><ul>
            <li>Water Requirements: Cotton needs moderate water levels throughout its growth cycle. Adequate irrigation is important during flowering and boll development.</li>
            <li>Temperature Range: Cotton is a warm-season crop and requires temperatures between 24°C and 30°C (75°F to 86°F) for optimal growth.</li>
            <li>Soil Type: Cotton prefers well-drained loamy soils with good water-holding capacity. Soil structure is important for root development.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum):</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Water Requirements: Tomatoes need consistent moisture levels, particularly during flowering and fruiting. Proper irrigation management is essential to prevent water stress.</li>
                <li>Temperature Range: Tomatoes are sensitive to cold temperatures. They thrive in temperatures between 18°C and 30°C (64°F to 86°F).</li>
                <li>Soil Type: Well-drained loamy soils rich in organic matter are ideal for tomato cultivation. Soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0 is preferred.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
